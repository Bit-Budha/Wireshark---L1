 Learning Wireshark with Me - Blee

Welcome to the Wireshark Learning Guide! This document will help you get started with Wireshark, a powerful tool for network protocol analysis.

Introduction
Wireshark is an open-source packet analyzer used for network troubleshooting, analysis, and communications protocol development. It allows you to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.

Installation
1. Download Wireshark:
   - Visit the [Wireshark website](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) to download the latest version of Wireshark for your operating system.
Hereâ€™s a Youtube video for guide: How to download and install Wireshark on Windows
2. Install Wireshark:
   - Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
I personally used the wireshark in my Kali Linux

Setting Up Wireshark

1. Edit Preferences:
   - Go to `Edit > Preferences` and choose the layout you prefer (Frame Layout).
2. Adjust Delta Time:
   - If needed, change the delta time settings to UTC.
3. Customise Colour Rules:
   - Set up colouring rules to highlight specific protocols or types of traffic. Navigate to `View > Colouring Rules` and adjust as necessary.
4. Set Display Filters:
   - Learn to use display filters to focus on specific types of packets. This is essential for efficient analysis.

Capturing Network Traffic
1. Check Interfaces:
   - Determine which interface Wireshark will use to capture packets.
   - Use the command: `help -> About Wireshark -> OK`
2. Capture Options:
   - Go to `Capture > Options` to manage interfaces and settings.
   - Adjust capture options such as `Manage Interfaces`, buffer sizes, and output locations.
3. Start Capturing:
   - Select the appropriate interface and click the `Start` button to begin capturing traffic.

Using Dumpcap for Command-Line Capture
1. List Available Interfaces:
   - Use the command: `dumpcap -D` to list all interfaces.
2. Capture Packets:
   - Choose an interface and start capturing with: `dumpcap -i 1` (replace `1` with the desired interface number).
   - Store the captured data: `dumpcap -i 1 -w /path/to/store/file.pcapng`
3. Advanced Capture Options:
   - Split files if needed: `dumpcap -i 1 -W /path/to/store/file.pcapng -b filesize:1000 -b files:10`

 Filtering Traffic
1. Capture Filters:
   - Define how data is brought into the network card. Set capture filters before starting the capture.
2. Display Filters:
   - Apply display filters to focus on specific packets of interest after the capture.
